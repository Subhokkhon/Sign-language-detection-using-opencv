# Sign-language-detection-using-opencv
This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Random Forest Classifier. The system captures images of hand gestures, extracts key landmark features, trains a classifier, and performs real-time gesture recognition using a webcam.
